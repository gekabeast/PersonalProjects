While not a useful program, it was interesting to learn about how pi is calculated.
It is an irrational number after all with an infinite number of decimal places.


The euler-product method was actually very interesting: multiplying an infinite series of 
terms to each other (each being the ratio of the next prime number and the nearest multiple of 4 to that prime).
How do prime numbers connect with pi?
