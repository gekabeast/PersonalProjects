I don't know why I made so many programs which could calculate pi. 
I think I just one day decided to understand how people know (or know how to calculate) pi to the exact value.
It is an irrational number after all with an infinite number of decimal places. I should probably do a program for e.
While this small project is not useful in any regard, it was fun to understand how pi is calculated.

The euler-product method was actually very interesting: multiplying an infinite series of 
terms to each other (each being the ratio of the next prime number and the nearest multiple of 4 to that prime).
How do prime numbers connect with pi?
